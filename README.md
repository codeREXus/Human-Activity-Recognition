## ðŸš€ Features

- ðŸ“± **Smartphone-based HAR** using accelerometer and gyroscope data.
- ðŸ§  **Machine Learning pipeline** for real-time classification.
- ðŸ§ª Preprocessing steps: normalization, segmentation, and feature extraction.
- âœ… Accurate activity recognition using classical models (LSVM, Decision Trees, etc.).

## ðŸ§  Algorithms Used

- **Linear Support Vector Machines (LSVM)**
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The project uses a public HAR dataset recorded from smartphone sensors. Each record contains:

- Accelerometer (X, Y, Z)
- Gyroscope (X, Y, Z)
- Timestamped labels (e.g., Walking, Sitting, Jogging)

> Refer to `dataset/README.txt` or Jupyter notebooks for preprocessing steps and data structure.
